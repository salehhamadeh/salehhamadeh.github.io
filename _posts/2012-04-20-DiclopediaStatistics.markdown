A week has passed since I uploaded Diclopedia to Google Play. To celebrate this event, I am going to share the statistics with you. Diclopedia wasn't as successful as I hoped it would be, but it wasn't bad nevertheless. As you can see, the first 2 days were a devastation, but the third day was the first day of progress. User installs were nearly 10/day during the 4th and 5th days. At the end of the week, the number of installs / day crossed the 10 installs/day and made it up to 18. My goal for the first month is 200 installs. Please give Diclopedia a high rating and a positive feedback in order to help me reach my goal.
