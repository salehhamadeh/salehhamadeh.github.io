Interning at [Yahoo!][yahoo] was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me. At the time of my internship, Yahoo had a lot of cash from its investments, and it was investing heavily on new products. It was a time of big change for the company. This gave me the opportunity to work on multiple cutting-edge products in the short span of my internship.

Work at Yahoo
-------------
At Yahoo, I worked on the search front-end team. My work involved lots of reading, programming, and communicating. Yahoo is a large company, and the products that they build are huge as well. A fun fact that I learned is that no one at Yahoo understands how the search engine works. Each team knows about its own domain, and each team helps other teams integrate with them. For that reason, the ability to communicate effectively is a requirement for success at Yahoo.

The best thing about working at Yahoo is that I got to meet many like-minded young people. Yahoo has an amazing cafeteria with an Italian cuisine, Indian cuisine, Asian cuisine, Mexican cuisine, and much more. The cafeteria is a great convenience for getting food and socializing with colleagues.

Silicon Valley Life
-------------------
What most people do not know about Silicon Valley is that it is much more than a technology hub. The bay area has a nice weather throughout the year. It is the perfect place for people who like the outdoors. There are mountains all around the valley, all of which have hiking trails with wonderful views. My favorite trail was Castle Rock Trail.

Aside from all the natural beauties, San Francisco is only an hour and a half train ride away. San Francisco is a beatiful city and has a spectacular view of the bay. The walk from Fisherman's Wharf to Pier 39 is my favorite. I have done that five times over the past summer.

One thing I did not like about Silicon Valley is that it does not have nice beaches nearby. The only good beach I could find was at Santa Cruz, which takes an hour and a half to reach by car.
