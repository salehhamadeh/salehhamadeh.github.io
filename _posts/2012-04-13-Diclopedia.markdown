After months of learning and development, I released my first app, Diclopedia, to Google Play. So, you may be wondering what Diclopedia is all about? Simply, it is an app that combines several dictionaries, thesauruses, and encyclopedias in one place. Thus, you can search for something on a wide bunch of references. In addition to that, it has some other nice features, such as search history and preferences. It is a must-have app to anyone who owns an Android phone. Check it out here:  [Get it on Google Play][diclopedia]
