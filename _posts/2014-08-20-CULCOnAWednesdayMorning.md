Now that two days of school have already passed, the students are starting to get back to the usual Techy routine. Some people are quiet, others are speaking in a low voice, and still others are falling. On the chair next to me, a Starbucks employee is snoring while holding a Starbucks coffee in her hand. Quite ironic, especially since it is 9:40 in the morning.

For the first time, I will include a photo in a blog post. The photo below is taken from the 2nd floor of the Clough Undergraduate Learning Center, which is also known as CULC. The space below is right in front of my Data Structures and Algorithms lecture class, which fits 200 people. The photo the before-class feeling of Georgia Tech students.
