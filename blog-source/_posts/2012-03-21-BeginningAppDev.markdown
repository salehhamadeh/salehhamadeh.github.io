Last month, I was a idle, and I just wanted to do, create, and invent something. That's when I decided to develop apps for my android phone. I started by going to Barnes and Noble and buying Hello, Android by Ed Burnette. So, I went home and started reading it. The first unit in the book taught me how to develop a Sudoku game. After I finished reading through all the chapters about user interface, graphics, multimedia, local storage, etc.., I felt that by this information I can do way more than a mere Sudoku game. As a result, I created a new project in Eclipse and began banging the keyboard. I'm currently developing a dictionary-like program with many exciting features. Hopefully, I will release it soon.
