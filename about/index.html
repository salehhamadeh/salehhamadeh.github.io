<p>I am a full-stack software developer based in San Francisco. I work on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reserve with Google</a>, helping users make reservations and appointments from Google Search and Maps. Before Google, I worked on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redfin</a>&#39;s search team.</p>

<p>I graduated from <a href="http://www.gatech.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia Tech</a> with a degree in Computer Science with concentration in devices and modeling/simulation. While attending college, I interned at <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo!</a> and <a href="http://brainjocks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrainJocks</a> as a frontend developer intern and a .NET developer intern, respectively.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m free, I like to hike, write, sit in coffee shops, and help small business get online.</p>
