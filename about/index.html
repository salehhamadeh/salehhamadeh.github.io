<p>I am a full-stack software developer based in San Francisco. I work on <a href="https://www.redfin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redfin</a>&#39;s search team and build everything from mobile gestures to geographical database queries.</p>

<p>I graduated from <a href="http://www.gatech.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia Tech</a> with a degree in Computer Science with concentration on devices and modeling/simulation. While attending college, I interned at <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo!</a> and <a href="http://brainjocks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrainJocks</a> as a frontend developer intern and a .NET developer intern, respectively.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m free, I like to hike, write, sit in coffee shops, and help small business get online.</p>

<p>If you have an interesting project for me or just want to talk, hit me up on <a href="mailto:saleh@shamadeh.com">email</a> or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/saleh-hamadeh/62/8b6/2a2">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
