<p>I am a full-stack software developer based in New York. In the past year, I started my own company building <a href="https://mailwatcher.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MailWatcher</a>, an email client that intelligently organizes and manages your mailbox.</p>

<p>Before starting my business, I worked at <a href="https://www.scale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scale AI</a>&#39;s 2D team as a staff software engineer and engineering manager. My team built image and video annotation tools and worked directly with clients to help them create the datasets they need for ML training. Before that, I worked on <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reserve with Google</a> as part of Google Maps and on <a href="https://www.redfin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redfin</a>&#39;s search team.</p>

<p>I graduated from <a href="http://www.gatech.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Georgia Tech</a> with a degree in Computer Science with concentration in devices and modeling/simulation. While attending college, I interned at <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo!</a> and <a href="http://brainjocks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrainJocks</a> as a frontend developer intern and a .NET developer intern, respectively.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m free, I like to hike, write, work from coffee shops, and help small business get online.</p>
