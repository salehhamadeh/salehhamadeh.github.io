RTP Customs is a wheel repair shop based in Acworth, Georgia. Before I worked with them, they did not have an online presence. I built their website on WordPress and wrote a custom theme and plugins to help them manage the website on their own. After building their website, I worked on Search Engine Optimization. I helped them become the highest ranked page on Google Places and the second highest ranked page on Google Search for the search term, "Wheel repair in Acworth".

Diclopedia is an Android app that let's you search for a term in a variety of dictionaries, thesauri, or encyclodias. I created this app when I was in high school to help me prepare for the SAT. After a year, I received my first paycheck from Google, and I realized that the number of users grew from 100 to over 20,000 without any effort from me. I added new features that users were asking for, like history and suggestions. Today, the app has more than 40,000 active users.
