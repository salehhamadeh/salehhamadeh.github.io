    <h1><a href='/blog/blogging/2013/12/24/MovingToJekyll.html'>Moving the Blog to Jekyll</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>After two hours of non-stop coding, I crafted this blog and added it to my website. Of course, this would have not been possible without the contributions of the open-source community, namely <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/schacon/schacon.github.com">Scott Chacon</a>.</p>

<p>For those who have never heard of Jekyll, Jekyll is a tool for creating blogs. I chose Jekyll for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>  It generates static websites.</li>
<li>  It is fully customizable.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will clarify what I mean by a static site. Unlike Wordpress and most other blogging tools, Jekyll does not need a database or back-end scripting. When I first read about that, it was impossible to believe. The site was saying that the blog works without data, which is essential for any blog. If this was true, then anyone can use Jekyll to host a blog using any of the free file servers. I can host a blog on Dropbox. I can host a blog using Apache ONLY. It turns out that what Jekyll claimed was true. Instead of being the blog, Jekyll is the blog generator. It takes in markdown files or text files, runs them through several parsers and templates, and creates a complete site with HTML and CSS. Since Jekyll blogs do not need any back-end scripting, it was the perfect tool for hosting a blog on Github Pages.</p>

<p>Since I use many tools to develop my website (<a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://fontawesome.io">Font Awesome</a>, ...), I prefer to use tools that do not conflict with the others. I love the tools that give the developers the freedom to use any other libraries and that focus on one thing and do it perfectly. Jekyll met both of my needs. As a website generator, it gives me the blog out of the oven. I did not use any extra link or script tags. Jekyll granted me full customization of the shape of my blog. Using the <a href="http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics">Liquid</a> template language, I was able to seemlessly integrate the blog posts with my website. Even though the blog and the site are two different projects on my computer, the blog appears to be part of the website when it is hosted online.</p>

<p>Jekyll was not only the best choice for my blog, but was also extremely easy to learn. I encourage anyone who is interested in Jekyll to install it, create an empty blog (it comes with all the necessary files), and skim through the blog&#39;s source code. Look at the code, tweak it, and read Jekyll&#39;s getting started guide, and you will have your own static and fully-customizable blog in no time.</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/android/2012/09/10/KSUBarbecue.html'>Kennesaw State University Student Barbecue</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>Last week, the International Student Association at Kennesaw State University held a barbecue that is open for all in the campus green. Because barbecue is the love of my life, I had to go. When I reached the location of the barbecue, I saw a line that seemed endless. The photo above shows nearly 2/3rd of the line. I felt a pain in my heart. I knew that there were grilled chicken, hot dogs, and hamburgers near me. The luring odor of the food was all around me. I can even smell it without a nose. Although the barbecue was less than 100 feet from me, I felt that it was at the other end of the world. Finally, I decided to stand in line before it gets even longer.</p>

<p>After waiting for more than half an hour, I reached the stall. At first, I took a plate of potato salad. Then, I took a burger. As I was heading toward the chicken, a girl stopped me. She said that I had to choose one of the following: hamburger, chicken, or hot dog. I suddenly felt very upset. After all what I had done, I can only pick one. So, I had a look at the choices in front of me. The hamburgers seem to be calling me, and the chicken was shouting with all its might for me. I couldn&#39;t resist the look of the juicy chicken. So, I took a piece of the chicken. Then, I grabbed my plate and took a seat at one of the tables next to the student center. Now is the time for the chicken to go where it belongs. When I had my first bite, I felt my mouth go on fire. Immediately, I got up and threw my plate in the garbage. I had never eaten something so spicy. As I was anticipating the symptoms of my allergy, I started sweating. Then, I felt that the temperature rose up 10 degrees. In less than a minute, I was feeling itchy and tears were going out of my eyes. I don&#39;t need to describe the other symptoms because I&#39;m afraid that a child may read this post.</p>

<p>I learned that I can never know how can something turn out. What has always appeared like a happy day actually turned into a nightmare. After that incidence, I felt really dumb because I hadn&#39;t even thought that the chicken might be spicy although I saw black pepper all over it.</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/android/2012/05/14/DiclopediaOneMonth.html'>Diclopedia is 1 Month Old</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>Diclopedia is getting quite mature now. During the first month, Diclopedia got better graphics, bug fixes, history, and suggestions. The total downloads for the first months are 432 downloads, which is not bad. Let&#39;s hope that as Diclopedia grows older, it will have much more features. If you would like to share your ideas with me, post them in the comments. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

    <div class='body'><p>A week has passed since I uploaded Diclopedia to Google Play. To celebrate this event, I am going to share the statistics with you. Diclopedia wasn&#39;t as successful as I hoped it would be, but it wasn&#39;t bad nevertheless. As you can see, the first 2 days were a devastation, but the third day was the first day of progress. User installs were nearly 10/day during the 4th and 5th days. At the end of the week, the number of installs / day crossed the 10 installs/day and made it up to 18. My goal for the first month is 200 installs. Please give Diclopedia a high rating and a positive feedback in order to help me reach my goal.</p>

    <div class='body'><p>After months of learning and development, I released my first app, Diclopedia, to Google Play. So, you may be wondering what Diclopedia is all about? Simply, it is an app that combines several dictionaries, thesauruses, and encyclopedias in one place. Thus, you can search for something on a wide bunch of references. In addition to that, it has some other nice features, such as search history and preferences. It is a must-have app to anyone who owns an Android phone.
