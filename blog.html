    <h1><a href='/blog/web/2014/04/06/Unvalidated-Redirects.html'>Web Security: Unvalidated Redirects</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>Did you expect to be on Google or some other page but found yourself here? Then, let me tell you that you were a victim to one of the top 10 web security threats: <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A10-Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards">Unvalidated Redirects</a>. Do not worry, you are in safe hands (this blog).</p>

<h2>What Happened?</h2>

<p>The link that you clicked is probably a redirection link, such as those found in Google&#39;s search results. Companies like Google and Twitter use redirection links to track where their users are going. It helps them gather information and hide information. For example, using redirection URLs, websites can:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Track where their userbase is going.</li>
<li>  Hide referral information (search query strings, etc...) from the websites that the users are redirected to.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is this a Threat?</h2>

<p>Most users who surf the web do not look at their address bar on every page they visit. To most of them, seeing that a link starts with www.google.com is enough to make the link trustworthy. Now if a malicious user creates a website that clones Google&#39;s login page and sends a redirection URL that starts with www.google.com, the victims are only 1 step close to sending out their password.</p>

<p>Other users may use this security weakness to get more traffic. If the &quot;bad&quot; users serve ads, they make more money.</p>

<h2>What Defenses can Web Developers Take to Keep their Websites Safe?</h2>

<p>The easiest way to keep your sites safe is to stay away from redirection using query string parameters. If this is not something that you can easily do, here are some strategies that you can use:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Keep a hash map of URLs. In other words, instead of having the URL in the query string, have a key that refers to that URL there. In this way, only the URLs for the keys that YOU define are redirectable.</li>
<li>  A better method is to have a domain name dedicated to URL redirections. <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> uses <a href="https://support.twitter.com//entries/109623">t.co</a> to track its users&#39; whereabouts while explicitly showing them that they will be redirected. <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> uses r.search.yahoo.com for the same purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Defenses can Users Take to Stay Safe?</h2>

<p>Look at the full URL before visiting a link. The first part of it does not tell you everything. For some URLs, this practice can be tedious. In that case, look at the URL every time you are about to submit a form or enter sensitive information.</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/programming/2014/03/16/AssessYourCollaborativeProgramming.html'>Assess your Collaborative Programming Skills</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>After working a couple of jobs in software development, I noticed that one of the most-valued skills that employers are looking for is your collaboration skills. In other words, you need to blend well with the other programmers. When you are first hired, you will spend a decent amount of time just going through the code to understand how things work. If you find yourself confident enough to start extending the code, then the person who wrote it is a collaborative programmer.</p>

<p>The first step to become a collaborative programmer is to keep in mind that one day a new programmer who had never looked at your code will need to work with it. I can&#39;t stress how important this practice is. There are many programmers out their who can do extraordinary stuff, but when a coworker looks at what they did, the coworker enters a labyrinth. When you go and ask the &quot;smart&quot; person about his code, you can see that he understands everything. This scenario is just like attending the lecture of a world-renowned professor and falling asleep in the middle of the lecture.</p>

<p>All programming languages have comments for a reason: comments are essential for every program. Comments are not only to help other people, but also to help you understand your own code. I was one of the people who would never comment a line of code. I used to think that if I wrote the code then I will always know what it does. I was wrong. Last year, I looked at the source code of a scientific calculator simulator that I had written 4 years ago. I felt as if I were reading some gibberish text. Commenting is a great practice for you as well as others.</p>

<p>Last but not least is consistency. Stay consistent in your code. I try to have all my variable declarations at the beginning of a function definition. Then, I follow it with the function&#39;s logic. If the function returns a value, I usually store the value in a variable named ret. It may sometimes be very tempting to declare a variable in the middle of a function or to use global variables to solve problems fast. However, keep in mind that quick fixes cause quick problems. There are no perfect guidelines for writing code. Every person is unique and has his own patterns. What is important is that you stick to your pattern. If you do that, you will not need to execute a lot of code in your mind to reach the spot that needs changing; you just go to it. A good analogy is audio tapes and CDs. Using an audio tape, you have to go through all the previous songs to reach the song that you want to play. In a CD, the drive goes to the song directly without having to go through the other songs.</p>

<p>So you think you can code? Think again. To assess your collaboration skills, write an app or a game, say tic-tac-toe. After 4 weeks without looking at the source code, add a new functionality to your game, such as a leaderboard. If you find yourself struggling in placing functions or moving data around, then you need to improve your collaboration skills.</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/web/2014/02/24/WebPerformanceTrends.html'>Web Performance Trends: One Load, That's All</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>After all the HTML 5 buzz, I couldn&#39;t but notice the new direction in which the web is being taken. At first, the Internet was a collection of pages (most of it still is). However, now we start feeling that some websites are not pages anymore. Take <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, a project management web application by Fog Creek Software, for a example. After signing into Trello, all your clicks show instantaneous results, and you feel that the website is really an application more than a website. However, the link in the navbar still shows that you are moving between pages. You know that your internet connection is not that fast, so what exactly is happening? Trello, along with many other <a href="www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA&#39;s</a>, utilize HTML5&#39;s History API to achieve this. The History API allows web developers to manipulate your browser&#39;s history (they cannot view it) by adding new links. In this way, the user thinks that he was directed to a new page when this is not quite the case. Client-side templating engines, like <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a> and <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>, can let the browser download the whole website upon the first load. Then, these websites use the History API alongside the client-side templating engines to render instantaneous pages.</p>

<p>Looking at the performace aspect of this technique, we can see that sites are shifting from the traditional load-on-page-request approach to the &quot;One Load, That&#39;s All&quot; approach. In this way, the website is going to take a longer time to download, but once it is downloaded, everything else is instantaneous. Using HTML5&#39;s LocalStorage API, one can save the website&#39;s pages and templates so that the user will not have to download the entire website every time he visits it.</p>

<p>However, the new approach has some limitations. First, they can only work that way on devices that support HTML5. Moreover, they require strong devices to run on, memory-wise and computation-wise.</p>

<p>So, what do you think is the better approach for websites at the moment?</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/opinion/2014/02/09/WhyYouShouldHaveACloudVM.html'>Why You should have a Virtual Machine in the Cloud</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p><a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> lets users access there files from anywhere and on any machine. Google Chrome lets users have their customized browser from any machine. By customized, I mean that it saves the settings, favorites, history, and saved passwords. The internet made it possible for people to feel that any computer is their personal computer. However, there is still one piece missing. Even though our files and preferences are shared everywhere, we know that we are not using our same computer when we go to the library or somewhere else. By having a virtual machine in the cloud, we will be able to use our computer from any machine. This is only one of the many reasons to get your private virtual machine.</p>

<h2>Reason 1: No need to carry a computer</h2>

<p>Everyone agrees that carrying a computer can be a hassle. Whether you are at the airport or walking alone at night, your physical computer is a trouble. By having a virtual machine in the cloud, you do not need to carry your computer because you can reach it from any machine that is connected to the internet.</p>

<h2>Reason 2: It is always on, and it works fine</h2>

<p>If you have ever tried serving a website from your home computer, you know how bad it is to keep it running 24/7. This can cause the computer to wear down, the fan gets louder over time, your internet connection slows down, and your family members complain a lot. With a cloud instance, all the maintenace is taken care of by the service provider. You can use the machine to serve as many websites as you want, make money out of it, and never get bothered.</p>

<h2>Reason 3: If you can program, then you can...</h2>

<ol>
<li>Track all your device locations from anywhere, If any of your devices is stolen, just make it ping your virtual machine and send the device&#39;s location to the cops.</li>
<li>Create a home controller that lets you do anything with your home from anywhere.</li>
<li>Develop POS systems for your neighborhood grocery for as cheap as $5/month.</li>
<li>Rule the World!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>If you are convinced by now, don&#39;t stop here. Take a look at the following cloud hosting providers and take action.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a>: Simple cloud hosting on Sold-State Drives.</p>

<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon EC2</a>: Advanced cloud computing service that comes along with tools to handle web applications, databases, storage, and more.</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/opinion/2014/01/12/CompScieOrSoftEngineer.html'>Computer Science VS Software Engineering</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>I could not count the number of times that I have been told, &quot;You got accepted in Georgia Tech, and you are studying Computer Science. You must be crazy. Go major in some kind of engineering instead. Georgia Tech is one of the top universities in that.&quot; At the same time, I hear people praising a person at another university who is majoring in Software Engineering. The sad thing is, people do not know what any of these majors really is. They also do not know that Software Engineering and Computer Science are different words used to identify the same thing.</p>

<p>Using two different words to identify the same degree creates confusion and misunderstanding. What do you think is the more suitable word? Computer scientist or software engineer. To be able to answer these questions, let us consider what the words <em>science</em> and <em>engineering</em>.</p>

<h2>What is science?</h2>

<p>According to Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, <a href="http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/science">science</a> is &quot;knowledge about the world, especially based on examining, testing, and proving facts.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Oxford Advanced Learner&#39;s Dictionary, <a href="http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/science">science</a> is &quot;knowledge about the structure and behaviour of the natural and physical world, based on facts that you can prove, for example by experiments.&quot;</p>

<h2>What is engineering?</h2>

<p>According to Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, <a href="http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/engineering">engineering</a> is &quot;the work involved in designing and building roads, bridges, machines etc.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Oxford Advanced Learner&#39;s Dictionary, <a href="http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/engineering">engineering</a> is &quot;the activity of applying scientific knowledge to the design, building and control of machines, roads, bridges, electrical equipment, etc.&quot;</p>

<h2>What do Computer Scientists or Software Engineers do?</h2>

<p>Computer scientists and software engineers build new things. They plan an application, a website, or a database and build that thing incrementally. Occasionally, they need the help of graphic designers and writers to make their products look good. Finally, they publish their product to the internet for end users to use it.</p>

<h2>The answer</h2>

<p>What do the steps above remind you of? They remind me of a civil engineer working on a skyscraper. They remind me of electric engineers creating escalators, lighting, and computers for a shopping mall. I believe that computer scientists should really be software engineers since they &quot;design, build and control.&quot;</p>
