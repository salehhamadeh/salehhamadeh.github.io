    <h1><a href='/blog/hacks/2014/12/09/CodingOnATablet.html'>Coding on a Tablet</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>Yesterday, the first day of finals, my computer decided to stop functioning. Since most of my finals are in Computer Science classes, I had to be able to program to study. The only devices I have in hand are my smartphone and my tablet. What can I do?</p>

<p>I chose to try the tablet since it had a bigger screen. Of course, iOS does not give me any freedom. So, how do  I overcome that? I remembered my cloud Ubuntu virtual machine. If I could only access my server&#39;s shell, I can run emacs to edit code and compile all my Java programs from the command line. I did a Google search and stumbled upon a nifty tool called Serveauditor. This is my SSH client to freedom.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/163831352/shamadeh.com%20assets/ipad-ssh-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>Using Serverauditor, I was able to both practice for my data structures final and write this blog post. As I do that, I continue to believe the saying, &quot;if there is a will, there is a way.&quot;</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/opinion/2014/10/10/TransferStudentsAreSmarter.html'>Transfer Students are Smarter than the Average Student at Their University</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>Yesterday, I met with a friend who, like me, transferred from <a href="http://kennesaw.edu/">Kennesaw State University</a>. We had a good conversation, and after we parted, I had a strange thought: &quot;Why aren&#39;t <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a> students as intelligent as KSU students?&quot; </p>

<p>Georgia Tech has one of the top engineering programs in the United States, while KSU is only well-known in the Southeast; therefore, there must be an error in my formula.</p>

<p>I pondered over the idea for a moment and thought specifically about the KSU students whom I thought were extraordinary. Among those students, 6 transferred to Georgia Tech, 1 transferred to Georgia State University, 1 joined the PhD program at Emory University, 3 transferred to University of Georgia, and 3 are still at KSU.</p>

<p>This made me realize an unusual fact. My friends from KSU are not smarter than Georgia Tech students because they went to KSU. They are smarter because most of them are transfer students.</p>

<p>After reflecting on my experience as a tranfer students, I feel confident about generalizing my hypothesis to include all students across all universities. Here is why:</p>

<h2>All Transfer Students Embrace Challenge</h2>

<p>During my senior year of high school, I applied to the top universities in the United States, and my backup plan was to go to Kennesaw State University. As you would expect, I was rejected everywhere except in KSU, so I ended up going there.</p>

<p>At KSU, I was admitted into the honors program. I had an amazing time there. School was easy. The atmosphere was relaxing. I had a good relationship with all my professors. Everything was wonderful. However, occasionally I felt that I was different from the majority of the students at the university. For some reason, my brain was telling me that I was not in the right place. I never wanted to earn an easy degree. I want my college experience to be challenging and to give me the greatest amount of knowledge possible. I also want to be surrounded with people who thought like me. For these reasons, I decided to transfer to Georgia Tech.</p>

<p>Students who transfer do that because they are looking for more challenge. They know that it will be harder than what they are used to, yet they take the leap.</p>

<h2>Many Non-Transfer Students go with the Flow</h2>

<p>After students graduate from high schools, they go to universities. Some go to top-notch and Ivy League universities, others go to average universities that serve their local area, and yet others go to community colleges. All these students have one thing in common: they do not know what is ahead of them.</p>

<p>I have countless friends who went to community colleges or smaller universities planning to transfer in the future. Later, most of them decided to stay where they were. They found university to be more difficult than they had expected, and they gave up the idea of transferring.</p>

<p>At Georgia Tech, I met many people from the other end of the spectrum. They were admitted to Georgia Tech as freshmen. Later in their lives, they struggled a lot with their studies. Now, their main goal is to pass and earn a degree from Georgia Tech. They are accepting the reluctantly accepting the challenge.</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/opinion/2014/09/29/HackathonsForABetterWorld.html'>Hackathons for a Better World</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>For those of you who do not know what a hackathon is, a hackathon is an event in which teams compete to create a product that will solve a real-world problem. Most of the people who attend hackathons are programmers or hackers, but hackathons are open to anyone who feels creative.</p>

<p>Last week, I attended <a href="http://hackgt.com/">HackGT</a>, a hackathon at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>. I was shocked by the amount of money that was spent on organizing this event. Aside from the food and travel reimbursements for 1,000 hackers, the grand prize itself was valued at about $140,000 ($10,000 in cash, $50,000 investment, $60,000 in Azure credits, and a trip to Boston). I estimate that the event gathered over $250,000 from sponsors.</p>

<p>It is amazing how companies are willing to put such an enormous amount of money to sponsor hackathons. However, what is even more amazing is the possibility of gathering the greatest minds in the universe and putting them under a single roof for 48 hours. Volunteers bring them food, drinks, and even pillows! To an outside viewer, a hackathon looks like a homeless shelter; to the competitors, a hachathon is heaven.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, hackers escape their lives&#39; duties and look at the world from a different angle. Every once in a while, people should take a break from the real world to keep their creativity ignited. A person can read a novel and go to wonderland. They can also go to a hackathon and turn our world into wonderland.</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/programming/2014/09/06/AgileAndSoftwareDevelopers.html'>How Agile Changed the Software Development Workplace</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>In the last three decades, software development has undergone a drastic change. Computer science started out as a mix of discrete mathematics and electrical engineering. As more people bought personal computers, most businesses sold their software for fixed prices. Nowadays, businesses are more user-oriented than product-oriented, and most of them depend on a steady flow of income, such as a subscription fees, rather than a fixed price. Throughout the process, offices transitioned from cubicles to open spaces, programmers from hobbyists to professionals, and products from executable programs to web applications. Two major changes fostered this transformation: Improved Connectivity and Easier Access to Data.</p>

<h2>The Waterfall Method</h2>

<p>Before the days of the World-Wide Web, software was shipped in the form of floppy disks. Since companies could not easily send updates to their users, the Waterfall Method emerged. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall Method</a> divides the software engineering process into the following stages:</p>

<ol>
<li>Requirements Specification: Gather information from clients and understand the problem.</li>
<li>Design: Propose a solution and develop a model for construction.</li>
<li>Implementation: Develop the full application.</li>
<li>Verification: Customer uses the application and confirms that it works as expected.</li>
<li>Testing: Heavily test application.</li>
<li>Shipping: Customer uses or publishes his application.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/163831352/shamadeh.com%20assets/waterfall-comic.png" alt="Waterfall Method Comic"></p>

<p>When I first saw the photo above, I immediately thought that this comic was nonsense. In the couple of internships that I had, everyone on the team had a say on the project and met with the customers to define the products. I only understood the meaning of this comic when I had an interview at a company that showed me the cubicle that I will work in. It was dark and quiet, definitely not my kind.</p>

<h2>Improved Connectivity</h2>

<p>The main reason companies were managed that way was the low level of connectivity people had back in the day. When a company spots a bug after it delivered its product, it will need to send floppy disks with the patches to all the consumers who bought the original application. Releasing a newer version of an application was a process that took several months and had enormous costs.</p>

<p>As the Internet became widespread and connection speeds escalated, it became easier, faster, and cheaper for companies to release updates for their software. Programmers need no longer worry about all the edge cases and every single security loophole before releasing the application. As more bugs are discovered, the programmers fix them and publish the updates.</p>

<h2>Easier Access to Data</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/big-data/what-is-big-data.html">Big Data</a> is a controversial topic nowadays. Data is the premise of some of the booming information industries, such as business intelligence, marketing automation, and targeted advertising. What once required going to libraries and searching stacks of dusty books can now be done with a Google search.</p>

<p>One branch of data is feedback. Let&#39;s take mobile apps as an example scenario. When software companies release an app and publish it to the Google Play store or Apple App Store, they get instant feedback from the users. They know the user&#39;s demographics, ratings, and all other usage statistics. Back in the day, getting feedback took so much effort, and it did not provide data as valuable as what we can get nowadays. Interviewing a person for feedback or sending him a message is not the same as the user writing the feedback right after the user runs the app. During interviews, people are usually affected by the environment and the interviewer&#39;s personality.</p>

<p>If one user has a problem, then there are other users who have the same problem. Therefore, user suggestions help companies build software that appeals to the majority.</p>

<h2>The Agile Methodology Emerges</h2>

<p>Soon enough, the world realized that the Waterfall Methodology no longer fits our era. The goal of the waterfall method was to get the application right the first time. That was a need because shipping or deploying software was a costly process. Now that deployments can be done in a matter of minutes or hours, the concept of continuous refinement started appearing. Not only can developers deploy apps quickly, but developers can also get instant feedback from their customers. Fast deployments and instant feedback are the foundation of the <a href="http://agilemethodology.org/">Agile Methodology</a>. The general stages of the Agile software development stages are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Design and implement a small set of features.</li>
<li>Publish the app.</li>
<li>Listen to user feedback.</li>
<li>Select new features based on user feedback and go back to step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/163831352/shamadeh.com%20assets/agile-comic.png" alt="Agile Method Comic"></p>

<p>Unlike the Waterfall Method, the Agile Method is against writing a full-blown plan. Plans are based on estimations and hypotheses, which are incorrect most of the time. A customer may want an app for arranging parties at first, but then he realizes that he really wants a social network. To increase customer satisfaction, software developers do not ask for everything and then build the product. Instead, software developers work with the customer to build the product. At the same time, the customer is frequently presented with demos and is in track with the internal tasks for managing the project.</p>

<p>Although &quot;stop planning and start coding,&quot; works for some projects, the better solution is &quot;plan only for what you need at the moment.&quot;</p>

<h2>The Workplace Shift</h2>

<p>The history of software engineering is completely changing the way we view computer science. When I meet new people and tell them that I am studying computer science, they think that I will spend the rest of my life in a dark cubicle typing an endless stream of zeroes and ones. Most people, excuse me for generalizing, view computer programming as the job for people who do not like to engage with society. Although this notion may apply to the programmers of the 80&#39;s, I forcefully refute that this is the case nowadays. Agile is transforming the software development workplace. Programmers are becoming engineers, and open offices are replacing cubicle.</p>

    <div class='body'><p>Now that two days of school have already passed, the students are starting to get back to the usual Techy routine. Some people are quiet, others are speaking in a low voice, and still others are falling. On the chair next to me, a Starbucks employee is snoring while holding a Starbucks coffee in her hand. Quite ironic, especially since it is 9:40 in the morning.</p>

<p>For the first time, I will include a photo in a blog post. The photo below is taken from the 2nd floor of the Clough Undergraduate Learning Center, which is also known as CULC. The space below is right in front of my Data Structures and Algorithms lecture class, which fits 200 people. The photo the before-class feeling of Georgia Tech students.</p>
