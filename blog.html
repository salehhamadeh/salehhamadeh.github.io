    <h1><a href='/blog/opinion/2014/01/12/CompScieOrSoftEngineer.html'>Computer Science VS Software Engineering</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>I could not count the number of times that I have been told, &quot;You got accepted in Georgia Tech, and you are studying Computer Science. You must be crazy. Go major in some kind of engineering instead. Georgia Tech is one of the top universities in that.&quot; At the same time, I hear people praising a person at another university who is majoring in Software Engineering. The sad thing is, people do not know what any of these majors really is. They also do not know that Software Engineering and Computer Science are different words used to identify the same thing.</p>

<p>Using two different words to identify the same degree creates confusion and misunderstanding. What do you think is the more suitable word? Computer scientist or software engineer. To be able to answer these questions, let us consider what the words <em>science</em> and <em>engineering</em>.</p>

<h2>What is science?</h2>

<p>According to Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, <a href="http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/science">science</a> is &quot;knowledge about the world, especially based on examining, testing, and proving facts.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Oxford Advanced Learner&#39;s Dictionary, <a href="http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/engineering">science</a> is &quot;knowledge about the structure and behaviour of the natural and physical world, based on facts that you can prove, for example by experiments.&quot;</p>

<h2>What is engineering?</h2>

<p>According to Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, <a href="http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/engineering">engineering</a> is &quot;the work involved in designing and building roads, bridges, machines etc.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Oxford Advanced Learner&#39;s Dictionary, [engineering][oxford-engineering] is &quot;the activity of applying scientific knowledge to the design, building and control of machines, roads, bridges, electrical equipment, etc.&quot;</p>

<h2>What do Computer Scientists or Software Engineers do?</h2>

<p>Computer scientists and software engineers build new things. They plan an application, a website, or a database and build that thing incrementally. Occasionally, they need the help of graphic designers and writers to make their products look good. Finally, they publish their product to the internet for end users to use it.</p>

<h2>The answer</h2>

<p>What do the steps above remind you of? They remind me of a civil engineer working on a skyscraper. They remind me of electric engineers creating escalators, lighting, and computers for a shopping mall. I believe that computer scientists should really be software engineers since they &quot;design, build and control.&quot;</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/web/2013/12/28/MakeABlogSocial.html'>Make a Blog Social (Without a Database)</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>What does it mean by saying that a blog is social? Social, by definition, means humanly-interactive. In other words, it involves different human beings interacting with one another. In this article, I will show you the 3 steps that I took to make my static <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> blog social WITHOUT using A DATABASE.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add the <a href="http://www.addthis.com/">Addthis</a> Smart Layer for sharing articles to social networks.</li>
<li>Create a mailing list to keep the blog subscribers notified about the latest news.</li>
<li>Add comments to each blog post.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Sharing on Social Networks</h2>

<p>The buttons that appear on the left-hand side of this page allow you to share any post on my blog to almost any social network you can think of. Even though this is a powerful feature, it is extremely easy to integrate it into your own website, thanks to <a href="http://www.addthis.com/">Addthis</a>. Go to the <a href="https://www.addthis.com/get/smart-layers">Addthis Smart Layers</a> page and customize the toolbar to fit your need. Then, click on Generate Code. This gives you HTML code, which you can paste anywhere inside your page&#39;s HTML. That&#39;s it! You created your blog&#39;s first social interaction service.</p>

<h2>Mailing List</h2>

<p>You may wonder how to create a mailing list without a database or any server-side scripting. Is it possible? It&#39;s not. However, there are Software-as-a-Services out there that do just that. The tool that I used for my own personal blog is <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">Mail Chimp</a>. Mailchimp is free, as long as you do not send over 12,000 emails per month or have fewer than 2,000 subscribers. First, go ahead and create an account on Mail Chimp. In the registration&#39;s sign up form, there is an Organization&#39;s Name field. You do not need to be an organization to use that. The Organization Name is really the name of your website or blog. When you create an account and sign in, you will see the dashboard, which will show you the 3 steps that are needed to get you started. First, click on Create a List and create one. I called my list &quot;Blog Subscribers.&quot; After you create your list, click on Lists, click on the list you created, and then click on Signup forms. This will show you a page with 3 different choices: General forms, embedded forms, and form integrations. General forms create complete forms for registration, embedded forms are forms that can be embedded anywhere on your website (just like the one I use on my blog), and form integrations allow you to use Mail Chimp with other web services. You can choose whichever one fits your needs. If you choose embedded forms, you will see a page where you can create your own signup form and design it so it looks good. After going through the form-building process, copy the form&#39;s HTML code and paste it wherever you want the form to appear on your website.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>No website is really social without discussions and arguments. Without chicken there is no fried chicken, and without arguments there is no social life. I guess that was a bad comparison, but you get the point: discussion is the key to social interaction.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.disqus.com/">Disqus</a> is an amazing tool that you find everywhere but may not know its value. That&#39;s exactly what happened with me. I remember seeing Disqus on many websites, but I had never tried to create an account to see what motivates all these people to use Disqus. Before 3 days, I decided to go to Disqus.com directly and see what it truly is. It turned out to be comments, profiles, a social media, and anaytics all-in-one. In addition to that, it was as easy as copying-and-pasting to integrate to my website.</p>

<p>Enough talking and let&#39;s start getting this done. Head over to <a href="http://www.disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and create an account. After that, click on the link that says, &quot;Add Disqus to your website,&quot; at the top-right corner of the screen. Fill out the site&#39;s name and category and then click on Finish Registration. Then, you should see a list of platforms that you can use Disqus with. Choose the one that best fits your needs. This should give you step-by-step instructions to add Disqus to your blog. If you click on Universal Code, you will get the HTML for adding Disqus. Copy the HTML and paste it wherever you want to add Disqus in your blog.</p>

<h2>TADA!</h2>

<p>TADA! You now have a website that has social-media sharing, mailing lists, and discussions. Give yourself a pat on the back and have a look at the great work that you have done.</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/sci-fi/2013/12/26/WhatIfCarsHadAPIs.html'>What if Cars had APIs</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>As I was reading <a href="http://readwrite.com/2012/08/21/u-michigan-launches-worlds-biggest-sandbox-for-wi-fi-connected-cars">this article on ReadWrite</a>, I had this unusual thought: What if cars had APIs? We have started to see the Internet of Things in toasters, lamps, and even <a href="http://www.quirky.com/shop/619-Egg-Minder-Smart-Egg-Tray">egg counters</a>. People are getting pretty crazy with their inventions, but until now we did not see innovations in the automobile industry. What if there was a Car Operating System that can know all of the car&#39;s internal details. What if there was a protocol for car-to-phone communication? Then, we can have custom dashboard apps that can be downloaded to tablets. We can detect all car thefts and bring justice. We can customize the safety of our cars using Python scripts. We can program the car not to run if the driver did not have the seatbelt on. We can put speed caps for teenagers. The car can send us notifications when oil needs changing, tires need air, or the car is out of gas.</p>

<p>What if car-to-car communication became a reality? If Car OS was connected to our GPS, the car can send driving directions to other cars in the form of requests. For example, my car will ask the car to my right, may I go right. The other car responds, go ahead. So, my car says that I am safe to turn right. Can this be the first step to commercializing driver-less cars? If it is, we may see car networks in the future.</p>

<p>What if cars were controlled by monitoring towers on the roads? The towers can be programmed to give the perfect car flow. There will be no more fighting to get to the next lane. No one will end up on a lane with a dead end. Traffic jams will fix themselves without stressing the drivers. The drivers can then have their cup of coffee or read the newspaper on the way to work. What if the car can read online newpapers instead of playing the radio?</p>

<p>What if the car network gets hacked. The hacker can make all the cars go to one direction. People&#39;s doors will be locked and won&#39;t open. Cars start running off bridges and hitting trees. People start flying out of the windows and get crushed by self-driving cars. Can this be the apocalypse, the day when the computers take over our virtual and real lives?</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/blogging/2013/12/24/MovingToJekyll.html'>Moving the Blog to Jekyll</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>After two hours of non-stop coding, I crafted this blog and added it to my website. Of course, this would have not been possible without the contributions of the open-source community, namely <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/schacon/schacon.github.com">Scott Chacon</a>.</p>

<p>For those who have never heard of Jekyll, Jekyll is a tool for creating blogs. I chose Jekyll for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>  It generates static websites.</li>
<li>  It is fully customizable.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will clarify what I mean by a static site. Unlike Wordpress and most other blogging tools, Jekyll does not need a database or back-end scripting. When I first read about that, it was impossible to believe. The site was saying that the blog works without data, which is essential for any blog. If this was true, then anyone can use Jekyll to host a blog using any of the free file servers. I can host a blog on Dropbox. I can host a blog using Apache ONLY. It turns out that what Jekyll claimed was true. Instead of being the blog, Jekyll is the blog generator. It takes in markdown files or text files, runs them through several parsers and templates, and creates a complete site with HTML and CSS. Since Jekyll blogs do not need any back-end scripting, it was the perfect tool for hosting a blog on Github Pages.</p>

<p>Since I use many tools to develop my website (<a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://fontawesome.io">Font Awesome</a>, ...), I prefer to use tools that do not conflict with the others. I love the tools that give the developers the freedom to use any other libraries and that focus on one thing and do it perfectly. Jekyll met both of my needs. As a website generator, it gives me the blog out of the oven. I did not use any extra link or script tags. Jekyll granted me full customization of the shape of my blog. Using the <a href="http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics">Liquid</a> template language, I was able to seemlessly integrate the blog posts with my website. Even though the blog and the site are two different projects on my computer, the blog appears to be part of the website when it is hosted online.</p>

<p>Jekyll was not only the best choice for my blog, but was also extremely easy to learn. I encourage anyone who is interested in Jekyll to install it, create an empty blog (it comes with all the necessary files), and skim through the blog&#39;s source code. Look at the code, tweak it, and read Jekyll&#39;s getting started guide, and you will have your own static and fully-customizable blog in no time.</p>

    <h1><a href='/blog/android/2012/09/10/KSUBarbecue.html'>Kennesaw State University Student Barbecue</a></h1>
    <div class='body'><p>Last week, the International Student Association at Kennesaw State University held a barbecue that is open for all in the campus green. Because barbecue is the love of my life, I had to go. When I reached the location of the barbecue, I saw a line that seemed endless. The photo above shows nearly 2/3rd of the line. I felt a pain in my heart. I knew that there were grilled chicken, hot dogs, and hamburgers near me. The luring odor of the food was all around me. I can even smell it without a nose. Although the barbecue was less than 100 feet from me, I felt that it was at the other end of the world. Finally, I decided to stand in line before it gets even longer.</p>

<p>After waiting for more than half an hour, I reached the stall. At first, I took a plate of potato salad. Then, I took a burger. As I was heading toward the chicken, a girl stopped me. She said that I had to choose one of the following: hamburger, chicken, or hot dog. I suddenly felt very upset. After all what I had done, I can only pick one. So, I had a look at the choices in front of me. The hamburgers seem to be calling me, and the chicken was shouting with all its might for me. I couldn&#39;t resist the look of the juicy chicken. So, I took a piece of the chicken. Then, I grabbed my plate and took a seat at one of the tables next to the student center. Now is the time for the chicken to go where it belongs. When I had my first bite, I felt my mouth go on fire. Immediately, I got up and threw my plate in the garbage. I had never eaten something so spicy. As I was anticipating the symptoms of my allergy, I started sweating. Then, I felt that the temperature rose up 10 degrees. In less than a minute, I was feeling itchy and tears were going out of my eyes. I don&#39;t need to describe the other symptoms because I&#39;m afraid that a child may read this post.</p>

<p>I learned that I can never know how can something turn out. What has always appeared like a happy day actually turned into a nightmare. After that incidence, I felt really dumb because I hadn&#39;t even thought that the chicken might be spicy although I saw black pepper all over it.</p>
